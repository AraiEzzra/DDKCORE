DDK uses modern encryption algorithms to keep users funds safe. Each DDK account has private-public key encoded into BIP 39 passphrase. Each connection session is secured by Ed 25519 key exchange and SHA-256 hashing algorithm. DDK security is grounded in [latest edition of Sodium library](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/).
